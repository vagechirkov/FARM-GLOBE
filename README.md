### üåç What is FARM-GLOBE?

FARM-GLOBE uses the FARM (FastAPI, React, and MongoDB) technical stack to provide a template for building robust and scalable group experiments online. Its flexible design allows for asynchronous transmission of artifacts between participants and real-time processing of responses. It therefore facilitates studying cultural and collective phenomena.

### üìù Description

The FARM-GLOBE framework is a powerful tool for creating online group behavioral experiments. While there are existing frameworks available, none of them met our specific requirements. Its FastAPI (Python) backend allows scaling to thousands of participants and easy integration of Python-based machine learning algorithms. Its React frontend allows designing flexible and interactive stimuli. FARM-GLOBE relies heavily on the core functionalities of FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. It provides key concepts and interfaces, but is shallow on abstractions. It is therefore highly customizable.

### üîç When to use FARM-GLOBE?

FARM-GLOBE is ideal for researchers and developers who need to create large and complex online group behavioral experiments that require real-time processing of participant responses and / or aynchronous transmission of responses between participants. Its customizability might make it the right choice for projects that go beyond the scope of other more tailored frameworks.

### ‚ùå When not to use FARM-GLOBE?

FARM-GLOBE may not be the best choice for those looking to create simple online behavioral experiments, as it requires some basic knowledge of web development to implement.
